# Vendor Manifest

| File | Role | SHA-256 | Length |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `astro-discussion-bridge-0.1.0-alpha.20260824.3.tgz` | Qualified Astro adapter prerelease input | `d800c2802f1a0818bc9a176899490d768960e09a06c9ae9ecc0efe4410e3cc53` | 110908 |

The archive is a release input, not canonical adapter source. Replacing it
requires an explicit version/provenance update and a rebuilt lockfile.

The archive contains 67 members (472,774 unpacked bytes), has npm SHA-1
`5e8f1fc384b2b123a2de86483d0bf58de591bfc7`, and npm integrity
`sha512-CPdxDdkUr6SPTtA+MQj2QoFJX628X0T3X0aXVs544AatbtvEINFEzHnMI4aJcSf6SfuUNcqDCV0oe+2lNp1x0g==`.

It is bound to immutable adapter source commit
`f92e0dad18091353133288dcc05074fbd6e21675`. A fresh `npm pack` from that
commit reproduced the exact SHA-256, npm SHA-1/integrity, member count, and
packed/unpacked sizes above. This manifest does not claim publication or
release acceptance.
