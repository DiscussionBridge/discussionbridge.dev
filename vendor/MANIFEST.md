# Vendor Manifest

| File | Role | SHA-256 | Length |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `astro-discussion-bridge-0.2.0-alpha.20.tgz` | Qualified Astro adapter prerelease input | `b63b62a40a1283d9b333f1a35c7b44da3976f029c8b2b9548ad2e0388d5f82f9` | 43930 |

The archive is a release input, not canonical adapter source. Replacing it
requires an explicit version/provenance update and a rebuilt lockfile.

The archive contains 43 members (163,905 unpacked bytes), has npm SHA-1
`8cffd4aefb847383cbe7dc9c4f8f47092c1267c4`, and npm integrity
`sha512-2nr6m7sGGy5tP4PUyv7y4s6EKUx/VCZHx7PMgsAQeZXKbpUxVDtUIjwywCP6sbGTLtvwwNMjW8p99qnlp9tpLg==`.

It is bound to immutable adapter source commit
`f0610945beedc4cca54c11440d4794ce92b17ff5`. A fresh `npm pack` from that
commit reproduced the exact SHA-256, npm SHA-1/integrity, member count, and
packed/unpacked sizes above. This manifest does not claim publication or
release acceptance.
