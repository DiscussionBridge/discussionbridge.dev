# Vendor Manifest

| File | Role | SHA-256 | Length |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `astro-discussion-bridge-0.2.0-alpha.19.tgz` | Qualified Astro adapter prerelease input | `1e4d7eaa4f02790ff262f9b279d428df2bf9fc5d286ade287912b5e5df277140` | 43930 |

The archive is a release input, not canonical adapter source. Replacing it
requires an explicit version/provenance update and a rebuilt lockfile.

The archive contains 43 members (163,905 unpacked bytes), has npm SHA-1
`f7ee337d6942f39b3689867b5dea7a87dd0ce733`, and npm integrity
`sha512-um3XsNQEG7JUC9FgyIpVy2GlYNe6CM10sG4mWN6WfVjiGJtYVOk2YU2+WDyRpYCyZ7s6a/lnt2Q/HC1lytpNjg==`.

It is bound to immutable adapter source commit
`b52a0999f567269805ba5ffa27faf3f40ed03688`. A fresh `npm pack` from that
commit reproduced the exact SHA-256, npm SHA-1/integrity, member count, and
packed/unpacked sizes above. This manifest does not claim publication or
release acceptance.
